KMDSchool is my proposed solution to "assignment 1" put forward by UVData/KMD

Developed in Visual Studio 2022

Integration.test provided for CRUD on the service. These are all executed using EF InMemoryDatabase.

To execute the service, just hit "Run" from VS. A Database with the name KMD.School will be created upon first execution. Make sure a Database server exists on the client with hostname "localhost", and current user can create databases on this server.
